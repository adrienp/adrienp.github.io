    <h1>Hi, I'm Adrien!</h1>

    <p class="lead">
      I'm an actor, writer, and comedian living in New York City.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been studying and performing improv and sketch comedy at <a href="https://chelsea.ucbtheatre.com/">UCB</a> since 2012.
      My shows have also gone up at <a href="http://thepit-nyc.com/">The PIT</a> and <a href="https://theannoyancenewyork.com/">The Annoyance Theatre</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2015, I started <a href="https://toscomedy.com/">TOS Comedy</a>, a Video Sketch Show that has been airing on <a href="http://www.mnn.org/">MNN</a> and <a href="http://www.bricartsmedia.org/">BRIC</a> Public Access TV Channels in NYC.
      My videos have been featured on <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/02/23/winter-sex/">Mashable</a> and <a href="http://FunnyOrDie.com/m/aa4l">Funny Or Die</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cowrote a musical comedy show called <a href="http://thepit-nyc.com/ceosmusical/">Meet The CEOs: A Startup Musical</a>, which ran at The PIT in the summer of 2016.
      I also have a monthly sketch show at The PIT with St. Olaf as part of <a href="http://www.boogiemanja.com/st-olaf.html">Boogie Manja</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But <em>way</em> before all that, I found my love for comedy while improvising with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SpoCoImprov/">Spontaneous Combustion</a> at Rice University starting in 2009,
      then training with <a href="http://newmovementtheater.com/">The New Movement Theatre</a> in Austin, TX and <a href="http://www.stationtheater.com/">Station Theatre</a> in Houston, TX.
